# More Sweat Compat

More Sweat Compat is a Minecraft mod for Neoforge that mainly adds integration between Cold Sweat and Mekanism.

### Integration with Mekanism

- Several machines that produces heat, like the Thermal Evaporation Plant, now heat the environment. 
- Heat dissipating from thermodynamic conductors also raises the temperature which makes it feasible to setup a central
  heating system.
- Complete radiation protection now protects against cold and heat. This generally applies to the Hazmat suit and the 
  Mekasuit.

### Cold Sweat tweaks

- Insulation raises the limits on what temperature is considered comfortable.
